# Dart Style Guide
<em>Written by Bob Nystrom<br />
<time pubdate date="2011-10-27">October 2011</time>
(updated October 2012)
</em>

As we build up an ecosystem of Dart code, it's helpful if it follows a
consistent coding style. A dedicated style guide for Dart helps us make
the most of the features unique to the language and makes it easier for
users to collaborate.

There will likely be things you disagree with in this guide. As the author,
there are things *I* disagree with. I hope you'll agree that consistency is
often worth more than our individual preferences.

Keep in mind that, like many things with Dart, this guide isn't carved in
stone. As the language evolves and we gain experience with it, our style
will evolve too. This means that there will inevitably be code that doesn't
follow the latest style, or places where the style guide is ambiguous or
open-ended. Bear with us and it will get better as the language and its
libraries settle down.

## How to read this

This guide is broken into a couple of sections roughly working from the macro
scale down to the micro. Sections contain a list of guidelines. Each one starts
with one of four words:

* **DO** guidelines describe practices that should always be followed. There
will almost never be a valid reason to stray from them.

* **DON'T** guidelines are the converse: things that are almost never a good
idea. You'll note there are few of these here. Guidelines like these in
other languages help to avoid the pitfalls that appear over time. Dart is
new enough that we can just fix those pitfalls directly instead of putting
up ropes around them.

* **PREFER** guidelines are practices that you *should* follow. However, there
may be circumstances where it makes sense to do otherwise. Just make sure
you understand the full implications of ignoring the guideline when you
do.

* **AVOID** guidelines are the dual to "prefer": stuff you shouldn't do but
where there may be good reasons to on rare occasions.

This sounds like the style police are going to beat down your door if you don't
have your laces tied correctly. Things aren't that bad. Most of the guidelines
here are common sense and we're all reasonable people. The goal, as always, is
nice, readable and maintainable code.

## Types

#### AVOID creating classes that contain only static members.

In Java and C#, all members must be in a class. In those languages, you
occasionally encounter classes that are basically namespaces: just bags of
static members. Dart, like Python and JavaScript, doesn't have this limitation.
You are free to define variables and functions at the top level.

Name collisions, when they occur, can be avoided by importing a library using a
prefix. The advantage to this is that when collisions *don't* occur (which only
the *user* of a library knows, not the creator), the user doesn't have to fully
qualify the name at every callsite.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't have *any* static members, but it should be rare
to create classes that have *only* static members. Instead, those should be
libraries. Most classes should represent things you can construct.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
num distance(num x1, num y1, num x2, num y2) => ...
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart bad %}
class GeometryUtils {
  num distance(num x1, num y1, num x2, num y2) => ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### AVOID defining a one-member interface when a simple function will do.

Unlike Java, Dart has first-class functions, closures, and a nice light syntax
for using them. If all you need is something like a callback, just use a
function. If you're defining an interface and it only has a single member with a
meaningless name like `call` or `invoke`, there is a good chance you just want a
function.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
typedef bool Predicate(item);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
interface Predicate {
  bool test(item);
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

## Members

#### DO use constructors instead of static methods to create instances.

Constructors are invoked using `new` or `const` which communicates clearly at
the callsite that an object is being created. Named constructors and factory
constructors in Dart give you all of the flexibility of static methods in other
languages, while still allowing the callsite to appear like a regular
constructor invocation.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
new Point.zero();
new DateTime.now();
new Address.parse('123 Main St.');
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
Point.zero();
DateTime.now();
Address.parse('123 Main St.');
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO use `;` instead of `{}` for empty constructor bodies.

In Dart, a constructor with an empty body can be terminated with just a
semicolon. This is *required* for const constructors. For consistency and
brevity, other constructors should also do this.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
class Point {
  int x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
class Point {
  int x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y) {}
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO place the `super()` call last in a constructor initialization list.

Field initializers are evaluated in the order that they appear in the
constructor initialization list. If you place a `super()` call in the middle of
an initializer list, the superclass's initializers will be evaluated right then
before evaluating the rest of the subclass's initializers.

What it *doesn't* mean is that the superclass's *constructor body* will be
executed then. That always happens after all initializers are run regardless of
where `super()` appears. It's vanishingly rare that the order of initializers
matters, so the placement of `super()` in the list almost never matters either.

Getting in the habit of placing it last improves consistency, visually
reinforces when the superclass's constructor body is run, and may help
performance.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
View(Style style, List children)
    : _children = children,
      super(style) {
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
View(Style style, List children)
    : super(style),
      _children = children {
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO use a getter for operations that conceptually access a property.

If the name of the method starts with `get` or is an adjective like `visible` or
`empty` that's a sign you're better off using a getter. More specifically, you
should use a getter instead of a method when it:

  * **Does not take any arguments.**
  * **Returns a value.**
  * **Is side-effect free.** Invoking a getter shouldn't change any
  externally-visible state (caching internally or lazy initialization is
  OK). Invoking the same getter repeatedly should return the same value
  unless the object is explicitly changed between calls.
  * **Is fast.** Users expect expressions like `foo.bar` to execute quickly.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
rect.width
collection.isEmpty
button.visible
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart bad %}
collection.sum // may be slow to calculate
DateTime.now   // returns different value each call
window.refresh // doesn't return a value
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO use a setter for operations that conceptually change a property.

If the name of the method starts with `set` that's often a sign that it could be
a setter. More specifically, use a setter instead of a method when it:

  * **Takes a single argument.**
  * **Changes some state in the object.**
  * **Has a corresponding getter.** It feels weird for users to have state that
  they can modify but not see. (The converse is not true; it's fine to have
  getters that don't have setters.)
  * **Is idempotent.** Calling the same setter twice with the same value
  should do nothing the second time.
  * **Is fast.** Users expect expressions like `foo.bar = value` to execute quickly.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
rect.width = 3;
button.visible = false;
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### AVOID wrapping fields in getters and setters just to be "safe".

In Java and C#, it's common to hide all fields behind getters and setters (or
properties in C#), even if the implementation just forwards to the field. That
way, if you ever need to do more work in those members, you can without needing
to touch the callsites. This is because calling a getter method is different
than accessing a field in Java, and accessing a property isn't binary-compatible
with accessing a raw field in C#.

Dart doesn't have this limitation. Fields and getters/setters are completely
indistinguishable. You can expose a field in a class and later wrap it in a
getter and setter without having to touch any code that uses that field.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
class Box {
  var contents;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
class Box {
  var _contents;
  get contents => _contents;
  set contents(value) {
    _contents = value;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### PREFER using a public final field instead of a private field with a public getter.

If you have a field that outside code should be able to see but not assign to
(and you don't need to set it outside of the constructor), a simple solution
that works in many cases is to just mark it `final`.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
class Box {
  final contents;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
class Box {
  var _contents;
  get contents => _contents;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO use `=>` to define members whose body is a single expression that fits on one line.

In addition to using `=>` for function expressions, Dart also lets you define
members with them. They are a good fit for simple members that just calculate
and return a value.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
get width => right - left;
bool ready(num time) => minTime == null || minTime <= time;
containsValue(String value) => getValues().some((v) => v == value);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### AVOID boolean arguments unless their meaning is completely obvious.

Unlike other types, booleans are usually used in literal form. Things like
numbers are usually wrapped in named constants, but we usually just pass around
`true` and `false` directly. That can make callsites unreadable if it isn't
clear what the boolean represents:

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
new Timer(true);
new Timer(false);
new ListBox(false, true, true);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Instead, consider using named arguments, named constructors, or named constants
to clarify what the call is doing.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
new Timer.oneShot();
new Timer.repeating();
new ListBox(scroll: scrollBoth, showScrollbars: true);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

## Type annotations

#### PREFER providing type annotations on public APIs.

Type annotations are important documentation for how a library should be used.
Annotating the parameter and return types of public methods and functions helps
users understand what the API expects and what it provides.

If, however, a public API does accept any type, or accepts a range of values
that Dart's type system cannot express, then it is acceptable to leave that
untyped.

For code internal to a library (either private, or things like nested functions)
annotate where you feel it helps, but don't feel that you *must* provide them.

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
install(id, destPath) {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Here, it's unclear what `id` is. A string? And what is `destPath`? A string or a
`File` object? Is this method synchronous or asynchronous?

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
Future<bool> install(PackageId id, String destPath) {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

With types, all of this is clarified.

#### PREFER using `var` without a type annotation for local variables.

Method bodies in modern code tend to be short, and the types of local variables
are almost always trivially inferrable from the initializing expression, so
explicit type annotations are usually just visual noise. Decent editors can
infer the type of local variables and still provide the auto-complete and
tooling support you expect.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
Map<int, List<Person>> groupByZip(Iterable<Person> people) {
  var peopleByZip = new Map<int, List<Person>>();
  for (var person in people) {
    peopleByZip.putIfAbsent(person.zip, () => <Person>[]);
    peopleByZip[person.zip].add(person);
  }
  return peopleByZip;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart bad %}
Map<int, List<Person>> groupByZip(Iterable<Person> people) {
  Map<int, List<Person>> peopleByZip = new Map<int, List<Person>>();
  for (Person person in people) {
    peopleByZip.putIfAbsent(person.zip, () => <Person>[]);
    peopleByZip[person.zip].add(person);
  }
  return peopleByZip;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### AVOID using `double` as a type annotation.

Annotating a parameter or variable as type `double` means not only that it *can*
accept a floating-point value, but that it *must*. It's a type error to pass an
`int` to it. Almost all code that can handle floating-point numbers works
correctly with integers, so the type you usually want is `num`.

An exception: if you know for certain that your code is performance critical
(think of your favorite physics engine), it *might* make sense to restrict types
to `double` because Dart's arbitrary-precision integers can be slower than
floating-point numbers.

But don't rush into doing this: the caller usually knows more about their
performance needs than the callee, and prematurely annotating something as
`double` prevents callers from using your code with integers.

#### DON'T type annotate initializing formals.

If a constructor parameter is using `this.` to initialize a field, then the type
of the parameter is understood to be the same type as the field.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
class Point {
  int x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart bad %}
class Point {
  int x, y;
  Point(int this.x, int this.y);
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### AVOID annotating types on function expressions.

The value of function expressions is their brevity. If a function is complex
enough that types are needed to understand it, it should probably be a function
statement or a method. Conversely, if it is short enough to be an expression, it
likely doesn't need types.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
var names = people.map((person) => person.name);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart bad %}
var names = people.map(String _(Person person) {
  return person.name;
});
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

## Names

#### DO name types using `UpperCamelCase`.

Classes, interfaces, and typedefs should capitalize the first letter of each
word (including the first word), and use no separators. Abbreviations should be
capitalized like words.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart good %}
SliderMenu
XmlHttpRequest
typedef num Adder(num x, num y);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO name other identifiers using `lowerCamelCase`.

Class members, top level definitions, variables, parameters, and named
parameters, should capitalize the first letter of each word *except* the first
word, and use no separators. Abbreviations should be capitalized like words.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart good %}
item
xmlHttpRequest
clearItems
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO name libraries and sourcefiles using `lowercase_with_underscores`.

Some file systems are not case-sensitive, so many projects require filenames to
be all lowercase. Using a separate character allows names to still be readable
in that form. Using underscores as the separator ensures that the name is still
a valid Dart identifier, which may be helpful if the language later supports
symbolic imports.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart good %}
slider_menu
file_system
peg_parser
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart bad %}
SliderMenu
filesystem
peg-parser
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

## Comments

#### DO comment members and types using doc-style comments.

These start with `/**` and end with `*/`. Within a doc comment, you can use
[markdown][] for formatting.

[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
/**
 * Parses a set of option strings. For each option:
 *
 * * If it is `null`, then it is ignored.
 * * If it is a string, then [validate] is called on it.
 * * If it is any other type, it is *not* validated.
 */
void parse(List options) {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### PREFER using a single-line Dart-doc comment if the comment is short enough.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
/** Returns the greater of the two arguments. */
max(a, b) => a > b ? a : b;
{% endhighlight %}</div>

#### DO use line comments for everything else.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
greet(name) {
  // Assume we have a valid name.
  print('Hi, $name!');
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart bad %}
greet(name) {
  /* Assume we have a valid name. */
  print('Hi, $name!');
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO capitalize and punctuate comments like sentences.

This doesn't mean that the comment must always be a complete sentence, though it
usually should. "Returns the number of items." is an acceptable comment.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
// Remove the last item from the collection.
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart bad %}
// remove the last item from the collection
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO use square brackets in doc comments for identifiers that are in scope.

If you surround things like variable, method or type names in square brackets,
then documentation generators can look up the name and cross-link the two
together.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart good %}
import 'dart:math';
// ...
/** Rolls both [Dice] and returns the highest rolled value. */
num greatestRoll(Dice a, Dice b) => max(a.roll(), b.roll());
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO describe method signatures in the prose of the documentation comment.

Other languages use verbose tags and sections to describe what the parameters
and returns of a method are.

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
/**
 * Defines a flag with the given name and abbreviation.
 *
 * @param name The name of the flag.
 * @param abbr The abbreviation for the flag.
 * @returns The new flag.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If there is already an option with
 *     the given name or abbreviation.
 */
Flag addFlag(String name, String abbr) {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

The convention in Dart is to just integrate that into the description of the
method and highlight parameters using square brackets.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
/**
 * Defines a flag. Throws an [IllegalArgumentException] if there is
 * already an option named [name] or there is already an option using
 * abbreviation [abbr]. Returns the new flag.
 */
Flag addFlag(String name, String abbr) {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

## Whitespace

Like many languages, Dart ignores whitespace. However, *humans* don't. Having a
consistent whitespace style helps ensure that human readers see code the same
way the compiler does.

#### DON'T use tabs.

Using spaces for formatting ensures the code looks the same in everyone's
editor. It also makes sure it looks the same when posted to blogs, or on code
sites like [Google Code][] or [github][].

[google code]: http://code.google.com/projecthosting/
[github]: http://github.com

You may complain that spaces take more effort to type. If that's the case, I
encourage you to pause your 8-track player, put on your parachute pants and go
out and find a modern text editor that makes spaces as easy to work with as
tabs.

#### AVOID lines longer than 80 characters.

Readability studies show that long lines of text are harder to read because your
eye has to travel farther when moving to the beginning of the next line. This is
why newspapers and magazines use multiple columns of text.

If you really find yourself wanting lines longer than 80 characters, our
experience is that your code is likely too verbose and could be a little more
compact. Do you really need to call that class
`AbstractWidgetFactoryManagerBuilder`?

#### DO indent blocks with two spaces.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
if (condition) {
  print('hi');
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO indent continued lines with at least four spaces.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
someLongObject.aReallyLongMethodName(longArg, anotherLongArg,
    wrappedToNextLine);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

You may indent more than four spaces to line things up if you like:

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
someLongObject.aReallyLongMethodName(longArg, anotherLongArg,
                                     wrappedToNextLine);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DON'T indent lines that are continued with a function expression.

The one exception to the above rule is function expressions used within larger
expressions, like being passed to methods. These are formatted like so:

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
window.setTimeout(() {
  print('I am a callback');
});
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Note that even though second and third lines are a continuation of the first,
they are not indented four spaces. Instead, they line up with the first line.
The second line is indented two spaces because it is a block.

#### DO place the opening curly brace (`{`) on the same line as what it follows.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
class Foo {
  method() {
    if (true) {
      ...
    } else {
      ...
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO use curly braces for all flow control structures.

Doing so avoids the [dangling else][] problem.

[dangling else]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
if (true) {
  print('sanity');
} else {
  print('opposite day!');
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
if (true) print('sanity');
else
  print('opposite day!');
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

There is one exception to this: short `if` statements with no `else` clause that
fit on one line may omit the braces.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
if (arg == null) return defaultValue;
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO use spaces around binary and ternary operators, after commas, and not
around unary operators.

Note that `<` and `>` are considered binary operators when used as expressions,
but not for specifying generic types. Both `is` and `is!` are considered single
binary operators. However, the `.` used to access members is not and should
*not* have spaces around it.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
a = 1 + 2 / (3 * -b);
c = !condition == a > b;
d = a ? b : object.method(a, b, c);
if (obj is! SomeType) print('not SomeType');
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
a=1+2/(3* - b);
c= ! condition==a>b;
d= a?b:object.method(a,b,c);
if (obj is !SomeType) print('not SomeType');
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO place spaces around `in`, and after each `;` in a loop.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++)
for (final item in collection)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO use a space after flow-control keywords.

This is unlike function and method calls, which do *not* have a space between
the name and the opening parenthesis.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
while (foo) {
  ...
}

try {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DON'T use a space after `(`, `[`, and `{`, or before `)`, `]`, and `}`.

Also, do not use a space when using `<` and `>` for generic types.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
<int>[1, 2, (3 + 4)]
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO use a space before `{` in function and method bodies.

This is an exception to the above rule. When a `{` is used after a parameter
list in a function or method, there should be a space between it and the `)`
ending the parameters.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
getEmptyFn(a) {
  return () {};
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
getEmptyFn(a){
  return (){};
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

#### DO format constructor initialization lists with each field on its own line.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
MyClass()
    : firstField("some value"),
      secondField("another"),
      thirdField("last") {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Note that the `:` should be wrapped to the next line and indented four spaces.
Fields should all line up (so all but the first field end up indented six
spaces).

#### DO use a space around `=` in named parameters and after `:` for a named argument.

<div class="good">
{% highlight dart %}
new ListBox(showScrollbars: true);
ListBox([this.showScrollbars = true]);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="bad">
{% highlight dart %}
new ListBox(showScrollbars:true);
new ListBox(showScrollbars : true);
ListBox([this.showScrollbars=true]);
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
