CONFIGURING YOUR MAC SYSTEM

* Ensure you have Ruby 1.9.3 or greater.
  * You can use brew (if you're on a Mac) or RVM (if you're on Mac or Linux)
* Ensure you have Python 2.7.
  * On a mac? You might want the binary install of Python at http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/
* Open a new Terminal.
* run 'sudo gem install bundler'
* run 'sudo bundle install' from the root of your dartlang project
* install Pygments
  * sudo easy_install Pygments
* Download and install the App Engine launcher: https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads
  * Tell App Engine to use Python 2.7 if it's not
    * It will say, in the log "you're using 2.6"
    * On a Mac?
      * Go to Preferences, and enter the direct path to the Python 2.7 binary,
      which you downloaded from http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/
        * The full path is /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7

DEVELOPMENT

* Make sure you are in the root of this project.
* Run the server: 'make server'
* Your web browser opens to http://localhost:8080
  * You may need to reload once.
* Edit, create docs as normal.

DEPLOYMENT

* run 'make clean && make deploy'
  * this builds the site and places everything into 'build'
  * this command also uses the current branch for the app engine version name
  * this command will then deploy the site
* You will probably need to grab a unique password from your Google Account settings.
  * Save this into the App Engine Launcher during the first deployment.
